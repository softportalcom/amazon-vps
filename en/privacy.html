                <p>WILL MY DATA BE SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES?</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>Third-party service providers.&nbsp;</b>Softportal has engaged with several trusted third parties-service providers (data processors) in order to provide the service. For instance, they provide us with services such as hosting, data management or direct marketing related services, so they need to access certain data on as needed strictly basis. Softportal requires all its providers to certify that they have adopted adequate organizational and security measures to comply with our data protection standards and require them to commit to adopting further legal safeguards. Where the relevant provider is located outside the Economic European Area (EEA), we require the signature of EU standard clauses.</p>

                <p><b>Legal reasons</b>: We may disclose personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or protect our rights.</p>

                <p><b>Business Transfers</b>: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policies (unless, of course, you consent otherwise). Also, in the event that Softportal or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets.</p>

                <p>Please visit our&nbsp;<a href="cookies.html">Cookies Policy&nbsp;</a>to know the data we and third parties process via the usage of cookies and other similar technologies.</p>

                <p>You can ask us for an updated list of third parties that process your data by sending a request to the email indicated in the next section.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2 class="geo16b">WHAT RIGHTS DO I HAVE?</h2>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>You can have control over the data provided, including the ability to request your rights to access, rectify and delete, restrict the processing, transfer your data, withdraw your consent and to object certain processing (i.e unsubscribe from our newsletter).&nbsp;</p>

                <p>You can as well unsubscribe from receiving our newsletter at any time by clicking the relevant button at the bottom of any email we send you.</p>

                <p>We will process your data to create a profile that will include the data you provide, along with data related to your behaviour in the web site, how you react to our email campaigns but will not be used for automatic individual decision-making purposes. This profile will be used to show you customized content and ads that will be more relevant to you. You can also opt-out from this type of processing at any time via the cookies configuration button located at the bottom right side of our site.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><b>IS MY DATA SECURED?</b></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We have adopted adequate technical and organizational measures to avoid alteration, loss or unauthorized access to your data: We select only trusted and certified providers that process your data and we take care that they have taken strict measures too. We and our providers also use encryption protocols to access or transfer your data and techniques to anonymize data to mitigate the risks in case of a data leak. All data&nbsp;mirrored on the separated dedicated servers.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2 class="geo16b">HOW CAN I KNOW IF YOU CHANGE THIS POLICY?</h2>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We will inform you sufficiently in advance if there are important changes and require your consent if any of those changes impact your privacy rights.</p>
