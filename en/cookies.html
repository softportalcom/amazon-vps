                <p><b>Advertising Cookies</b>&nbsp;. We use cookies to make advertising more attractive to users. Cookies are often used to select ads based on content that is relevant to a user, improve reporting of ads campaign performance and avoid showing ads that the user has already seen. Conversion cookies are also used so that advertisers may determine the number of times that people who click on the ads end up buying their products. These cookies allow Softportal and the advertiser to know that you have clicked on the ad and that you have subsequently accessed the site of the advertiser.</p>

                <p>To serve you interest-based ads, we use information such as your interactions with Softportal sites, content, or services. We do not use personally identifiable information such as name or e-mail to serve interest-based ads. In serving you interest-based ads we only keep information collected for as long as required to provide our advertising services.</p>

                <p>We and our partners use the information collected by means of these cookies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on Softportal sites and third-party sites. We work with DoubleClick, a platform provided by Google Ireland Limited, which helps us gather information about our audience, helping us to manage the ads and marketing campaigns that are published on our website (positions, campaign duration, formats, link, tracking, etc). Approved third parties&rsquo; ad partners may also set cookies when you interact with Softportal. Third parties include social media networks and advertising companies.

                <p>We work with third parties, such as advertisers, publishers, social media networks, search engines, ad serving companies, and advertising companies working on their behalf, to improve the relevance of ads we serve. In providing you interest-based ads we do not associate your interactions on unaffiliated sites with personally identifiable information, and we do not provide any personally identifiable information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. Advertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who has viewed a page of a particular software). They may automatically receive an IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, show you more relevant advertising content, and perform services on behalf of Softportal.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19x8LT1SXWMYY6gOurePTtnQ3LBOzwi_MWS5tgHrsEW8/edit#gid=0" style="box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent; color: rgb(66, 139, 202); text-decoration-line: none; margin-bottom: 0px;">Learn more&nbsp;</a>about third parties that may set cookies when you use Softportal.</p>

                <p>Our website further uses other advertising IDs (such as the ones from Criteo and Facebook pixels, and Liveramp for US and India Softportal&rsquo;s websites).

In particular, Facebook Pixel is placed by Facebook; It is a third-party advertising type of cookie that enables Softportal to measure, optimize and build audiences for advertising campaigns served on Facebook.

                <p>We also use ID5 Universal ID. This technology enables us to create unified anonymous IDs that are unique for each visitor and are used to display personalised advertisements to you by means of a first-party cookie, which may capture your IP address, browser version and/or type , operating system version and / or type.

                <p>Our website uses JavaScript too to detect the use of ad blocking extensions for web browsers. This script is implemented in the source code of our website. The script simulates the display of an ad and confirms that it is displayed on a user&rsquo;s device. To do this, we do not store any information on users&rsquo; devices and process no personal data. If we detect that a user deploys an ad blocker, we may interact with them on the use of ad blockers and/or adapt the content available to them. If a user no longer wants us to use ad blocker detection mechanisms, they may opt-out by leaving the web site. We reserve the right to restrict access to our websites if users do not agree to the use of ad blocker detection mechanisms.</p>
